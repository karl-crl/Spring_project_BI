## Project description

SPAN(Semi-supervised Peak ANalyzer) ---  is a tool for analyzing ChIP-seq / ATAC-seq data supporting ultra-low and single-cell input. SPAN creates 3 state HMM model to fit data. Zinba tool (http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/7/R67) use pretty simular model to fit data but it also provides an opportunity to add additional information about data such as GC-content, mappability, etc. In this project we want to approach this ability.
 
## Goals and objectives
The aims of the project:
1) Study SPAN
2) Create classes for model and add to bioinf_commons
3) 




2) Create class for weighted regression
3) Create abstract class for regression
4) Create class for poisson regression
5) Create class for mixture
